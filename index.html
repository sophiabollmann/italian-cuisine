        <strong> Italian cuisine </strong> (Italian: <em>cucina italiana</em>)
        is a Mediterranean cuisine[1] consisting of the ingredients, recipes and
        cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula and later
        spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora. Some of
        these foods were imported from other cultures. <br /><br />
        Italian cuisine offers an <u>abundance of taste</u>, and is one of the
        most popular and copied around the world. One of the main
        characteristics of Italian cuisine is its <u>simplicity</u>, with many
        dishes made up of few ingredients, and therefore Italian cooks often
        rely on the quality of the ingredients, rather than the complexity of
        preparation.
